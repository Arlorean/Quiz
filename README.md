My turn to do a Saturday night quiz on Zoom during Lockdown and instead of going with PowerPoint I decided to try to explore [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

There are 6 rounds to the quiz, half with a UK-centric slant:
1. The Simpsons
2. Eurovision
3. British Bridges
4. Fright Night
5. 1980's Music Emoji
6. Whose baby is that?

The quiz is live at [https://arlorean.github.io/Quiz](https://arlorean.github.io/Quiz).

The images were taken from a Google Image search in lieu of finding CC0 replacements. They are not covered by the project license.

The Reveal.js code is [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/LICENSE).

The whole quiz is CC0 1.0 Universal (completely public domain and free to use).
